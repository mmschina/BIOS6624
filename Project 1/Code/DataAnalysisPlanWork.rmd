Questions of Interest: How treatment response 2 years after initiating HAART differs between subjects who report using hard drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, at baseline and other subjects, who did not report hard drug use at baseline.
Overarching Question: Could hard_drug explain difference in adherence?


Variables of Interest:  VLOAD, LEU3N, AGG_PHYS, AGG_MENT
Primary Predictor:  hard_drugs at baseline
Covariates Adjusting for:  ADH, RACE, EDUCBAS, SMOKE


```{r, echo = F}
# Since we are only interested in response 2 years after starting treatment, all visits/years after 2 can be excluded
# Subsetting dataset to only baseline, year 1 and year 2.
hiv_data <- hiv_data %>%
  filter(years %in% c(0,2))

# Removing any individuals missing either baseline or visit at year 2 
hiv_data_cleaned <- hiv_data %>%
  group_by(newid) %>%
  filter(n() == 2) %>%
  ungroup() 

```



```{r, echo = F}
# Note that we are only interested in hard_drugs indicator at baseline and not during the study
# Creating hard_drugs_baseline variable for each patient
hiv_data_cleaned <- hiv_data_cleaned %>%
  group_by(newid) %>%
  mutate(hard_drugs_baseline = hard_drugs[years == 0]) %>%
  ungroup()

Evaluating outcomes of interest to determine if transformations are necessary

```{r, echo = F}
## Initial plots of distributions
# Histogram of Viral Load
ggplot(hiv_data_cleaned, aes(x = VLOAD)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "cornflowerblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Viral Load",
       y = "Count")

# Histogram of T-Cell Count
ggplot(hiv_data_cleaned, aes(x = LEU3N)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "cornflowerblue", color = "black", binwidth = 50) +
  labs(x = "T-Cell Count",
       y = "Count")

# Histogram of QOL Mental Score
ggplot(hiv_data_cleaned, aes(x = AGG_MENT)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "cornflowerblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "QOL Mental",
       y = "Count")

# Histogram of QOL Physical Score
ggplot(hiv_data_cleaned, aes(x = AGG_PHYS)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "cornflowerblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "QOL Mental",
       y = "QOL Physical")


# Testing skewness using the moment package
skewness(hiv_data_cleaned$VLOAD, na.rm = TRUE)
skewness(hiv_data_cleaned$LEU3N, na.rm = TRUE)
skewness(hiv_data_cleaned$AGG_MENT, na.rm = TRUE)
skewness(hiv_data_cleaned$AGG_PHYS, na.rm = TRUE)

```


Appears that log transforming Viral Load may be appropriate. Other three variables look ok without transformations, residual plots of final models will be assessed to confirm this.


```{r, echo = F}
# Assessing if log transforming Viral Load is appropriate
ggplot(hiv_data_cleaned, aes(x = log(VLOAD))) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "cornflowerblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Viral Load",
       y = "Count")

# Log transforming Viral Load in the dataset
hiv_data_cleaned <- hiv_data_cleaned %>%
  mutate(log_vload = log(VLOAD))

```
